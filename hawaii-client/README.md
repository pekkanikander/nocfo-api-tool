# Hawaii Client

> **Status:** Revalidated against the live NoCFO test environment on April 7, 2026.

This folder contains the fifth iteration of our NoCFO API explorations:
an F# façade over Hawaii-generated types with lazy streams, hydratable domain entities,
and a handful of F# script sandboxes.
It is intentionally lightweight so the patterns are easy to lift into other projects.

```

Scripts with the `Test*.fsx` prefix expect the compiled library in `bin/Debug` plus the generated DLLs under `generated/bin`.
They are small, self-contained experiments rather than polished CLI tools.

Read-only scripts:
- `TestClient.fsx`
- `TestPatchShape.fsx`
- `TestAlignAccountsPermissive.fsx`
- `TestCsvReadDeltas.fsx`
- `TestBalance.fsx`

Mutating or potentially mutating scripts:
- `TestStreams.fsx` (patches an account near the end)
- `TestAccountUpdates.fsx`
- `TestCreate*.fsx`
- `api-spec-test.sh` (not recommended; can pollute server state)

The CLI under `../tools` links against this project. When you evolve the domain
surface or CSV helpers, remember that the CLI depends on those modules directly.

## Prerequisites

- .NET 10 SDK (`dotnet --version` ≥ 10.0).
- Access to the NoCFO API and a valid personal access token.
- `NOCFO_TOKEN` exported in your shell.
- The base URL defaults to `https://api-tst.nocfo.io`, the test environment.
- Optional: `NOCFO_BASE_URL` if you need to point at another cluster; it must be an absolute URI.
- If a local `.env` exists, you may `source .env` before running commands here. That file is local-only and not committed to GitHub.

Token management portals:
- Test: <https://login-tst.nocfo.io/auth/tokens/>
- (Production: <https://login.nocfo.io/auth/tokens/>)

## Build Once, Then Explore

```bash
cd hawaii-client
dotnet build
export NOCFO_TOKEN="paste-your-token"
```

If you have a local `.env`, you can use this instead:

```bash
source .env
cd hawaii-client
dotnet build
```

After the build, the scripts can be run in place with `dotnet fsi <script.fsx>`. Highlights:

- `TestStreams.fsx` – Streams the first few businesses, then accounts, using the `Domain.Streams` wrappers.
- `TestBalance.fsx` – Computes a simple trial balance by hydrating accounts lazily and folding by `AccountClass`.
   Requires setting Business slug into the source code. Fails without.
- `TestClient.fsx` – Raw HTTP smoke test that bypasses the higher-level abstractions.
- `RawHttpTest.fsx` / `STRPTest.fsx` – Repro harnesses from earlier debugging sessions; consult the comments before using.

Some legacy scripts (`TestAsyncSeq.fsx`, etc.) capture older experiments and may need small adjustments if you want to re-run them with the current `Http` module.

## How the Pieces Fit

- `Http.createHttpContext` normalises the base URL (always `/v1`) and attaches `Authorization: Token <value>` to each request. All HTTP helpers surface a structured `HttpError` DU (`Unauthorized`, `NotFound`, `RateLimited`, `ServerError`, `ClientError`, `ParseError`) and retry automatically on 429/5xx with exponential backoff.
- `AsyncSeqHelpers.paginateByPageSRTP` expresses “fetch page → yield results → follow `next`” as an `AsyncSeq<Result<'a,_>>`, preserving ordering and letting callers apply back-pressure.
- `Streams.streamBusinesses` / `streamAccounts` wrap generated DTOs in domain types, ensuring we always carry hydration hooks inside `Hydratable`.
- `Domain.Hydratable` plus `Streams.hydrateAndUnwrap` give consumers (CLI + scripts) the choice between lazy partials and eagerly hydrated entities.
- `Account.executeDeltaUpdates` and `Contact.executeDeltaUpdates` drive update flows by fetching the current entity for each CSV `id`, diffing, and PATCHing in CSV order
- `Streams.executeAccountCommands` interprets commands and converts them into HTTP API calls.
- `Reports.addToTotals` shows how to write deterministic folds on top of the streaming surface; treat it as a template for new reporting modules.

Use `Domain-design.md` for the higher-level rationale before touching alignment logic or hydration semantics.

## How `tools/` depends on this project

`dotnet run --project tools -- …` is a thin Argu-based CLI that reuses nearly every module here:

- `Nocfo.Tools.Runtime` builds on `Http.createHttpContext` + `Accounting.ofHttp`.
- `BusinessResolver.resolve` (from `Domain.fs`) is how the CLI maps free-form IDs to a `BusinessContext`.
- `Streams.streamBusinesses` / `streamAccounts` plus `hydrateAndUnwrap` provide the listing flows.
- `Account.executeDeltaUpdates` / `Contact.executeDeltaUpdates` implement per-row `update`
- `Streams.executeAccountCommands` implements account deletes.
- `Nocfo.CsvHelpers` defines the CsvHelper converters that keep our CSV exports/imports deterministic.

If you add or rename domain types, plan to update both this README and `tools/README.md` so users understand which commands are affected.

## Extending the client

1. Add or adjust paths in `src/Endpoints.fs`.
2. Compose a stream using `Streams.streamPaginated` or a custom AsyncSeq that fetches the endpoint and maps DTOs into domain types.
3. If the entity benefits from lazy hydration, create a `Hydratable` wrapper similar to `Account`.
4. Extend `Domain` with diff/command helpers so CLI-style workflows stay declarative.
5. Add CSV helpers (if needed) and expose them via a script or CLI command to exercise the flow end-to-end.

The `Account` modules are the most complete example of this pattern (listing, delta computation, execution).
Mirror that approach for new entities (e.g., documents, transactions).

## Refreshing the OpenAPI spec

The canonical schema in this repo is `../api/openapi.json`.
Grab a fresh copy from the NoCFO docs endpoint before regenerating the client:

Run `curl` from the repo root:

   ```bash
   # Test (default)
   curl --fail --silent --show-error \
     -H "Accept: application/vnd.oai.openapi+json;version=3.0" \
     "https://api-tst.nocfo.io/openapi/" \
     > api/openapi.json

   # Production (if you need parity with live data)
   curl --fail --silent --show-error \
     -H "Accept: application/vnd.oai.openapi+json;version=3.0" \
     "https://api-prd.nocfo.io/openapi/" \
     > api/openapi.json
   ```

Commit the updated schema before running Hawaii so the generated sources remain reproducible.

## Regenerating the Hawaii Output

We keep the generated code checked in so you can build immediately. Regenerate only when the upstream OpenAPI spec changes.

1. From the repo root, build the local Hawaii fork:
   ```bash
   dotnet build vendor/Hawaii/src/Hawaii.fsproj -c Release
   ```

Our forked generator in `vendor/Hawaii` includes fixes for nullable fields,
enum parsing, and operation name normalization that we relied on during November 2025.
If you use an upstream Hawaii, cross-check that those fixes have landed.

2. Still from the repo root, run the resulting Hawaii CLI against `hawaii-client/nocfo-api-hawaii.json`:
   ```bash
   dotnet ./vendor/Hawaii/src/bin/Release/net6.0/Hawaii.dll \
      --config ./hawaii-client/nocfo-api-hawaii.json \
      --no-logo
   ```

   The current config assumes you run this command from the repo root: `schema` is resolved from the working directory, while `output` is resolved relative to the config file.

3. Rebuild everything from the repo root to verify the regenerated code compiles:

   ```bash
   dotnet build
   dotnet test
   ```

**Operational note:** the local Hawaii fork still targets `net6.0`, so modern .NET SDKs emit support warnings during build. That warning is expected for now.

**Known generator workaround:**
`hawaii-client/nocfo-api-hawaii.json` overrides `AttachmentInstance.analysis_results` to a dummy nullable string.
Hawaii (as of Nov 2025) cannot serialize multipart fields that are arrays of objects,
so this keeps the generated client compiling even though the upload endpoint still accepts the real structure server-side.
If you start using that endpoint, revisit the override (or teach Hawaii how to encode complex multipart parts).

## Optional: Spec Drift Check (not recommended)

`api-spec-test.sh` can run Schemathesis and Dredd against a live server to spot
drift between the spec and production.
It is a convenience wrapper; you need `NOCFO_TOKEN` plus local installations
(or fallback commands) for Schemathesis, Dredd, `uvx`, and `python3`.

Note that running **Schemathesis may pollute you server environment.** Be careful.

```bash
./api-spec-test.sh --token "$NOCFO_TOKEN" \
  --spec ../api/openapi.json \
  --base-url https://api-tst.nocfo.io \
  --out ../api/reports/api-spec
```

The script produces a short Markdown summary alongside the raw JUnit/HAR artifacts.

## Running the Unit Tests

The `tests/` project (at the repo root) covers the pure modules in this library with no network access:

```bash
dotnet test tests
```

See `tests/` and the **Testing Approach** section in `CLAUDE.md` for details, including the pattern required when asserting on `inline` SRTP functions with Unquote.

## What’s Next (if you continue)

- Extend `Domain.Streams` to other endpoints (transactions, documents) so the CLI can manage more entities.
- Upstream the Hawaii generator patch set instead of pinning to the local fork.

Until then, treat this folder as a living notebook of the first workable Hawaii-based NoCFO client.
Lift ideas, refactor freely, and keep the scripts runnable so future explorers can reproduce the flows quickly.
