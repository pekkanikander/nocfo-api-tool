# `nocfo` CLI (tools/)

Thin Argu-based CLI that exercises the `hawaii-client` library (without touching
the F# scripts there.)

Treat this as the user-facing path for listing businesses/documents/accounts and updating/deleting accounts via CSV.

## Quick start

```bash
dotnet build ../hawaii-client
export NOCFO_TOKEN="paste-your-token"
export NOCFO_SOURCE_TOKEN="paste-your-prod-token"   # needed for `map accounts`

dotnet run --project tools -- list businesses \
  --fields "id,name,slug" > businesses.csv

dotnet run --project tools -- list accounts \
  -b <business-id> --fields id number name type > accounts.csv

dotnet run --project tools -- list contacts \
  -b <business-id> --fields "id,name,email,identifier" > contacts.csv

dotnet run --project tools -- list documents \
  -b <business-id> --fields "id,number,date,balance" > documents.csv

# edit accounts.csv keeping `id`
dotnet run --project tools -- update accounts \
  -b <business-id> --fields "id,number,name" < accounts.csv

# edit contacts.csv keeping `id`
dotnet run --project tools -- update contacts \
  -b <business-id> --fields "id,name,invoicing_email,notes" < contacts.csv

# map account IDs across environments by account number
dotnet run --project tools -- map accounts \
  -b <business-id> > csv/account-id-map.csv

# create documents in target environment from minimal CSV
dotnet run --project tools -- create documents \
  -b <target-business-id> \
  --account-id-map csv/account-id-map.csv \
  < csv/documents-create.csv
```

If a local `.env` exists, you may `source .env` first and skip the manual exports. That file is local-only and is not committed to GitHub.

Requirements:

- .NET 10 SDK
- `NOCFO_TARGET_TOKEN` (preferred) or fallback `NOCFO_TOKEN` (required)
- `NOCFO_TARGET_BASE_URL` (optional), fallback `NOCFO_BASE_URL`, default `https://api-tst.nocfo.io`
- `NOCFO_SOURCE_TOKEN` (required for `map accounts`)
- `NOCFO_SOURCE_BASE_URL` (optional, default `https://api-prd.nocfo.io`)
- Build artifacts: run `dotnet build` from the repo root (uses `nocfo.sln`)

## Command surface

Read-only commands:
- `list businesses`
- `list accounts`
- `list contacts`
- `list documents`
- `map accounts`

Mutating commands:
- `update accounts`
- `update contacts`
- `delete accounts`
- `delete contacts`
- `delete documents`
- `create documents`

| Command | Description | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `list businesses [--fields …]` | Streams every business the token can access and writes CSV | Default columns are the DTO fields; use `--fields` to select a subset |
| `list accounts -b <id> [--fields …]` | Resolves the business (Y-tunnus or VAT code), streams accounts, hydrates them, writes CSV | Rows are currently emitted in API order |
| `list contacts -b <id> [--fields …]` | Resolves the business (Y-tunnus or VAT code), streams contacts, hydrates them, writes CSV | Contacts are emitted from the `/contacts/` endpoint |
| `list documents -b <id> [--fields …]` | Resolves the business (Y-tunnus or VAT code), streams documents, hydrates them, writes CSV | Documents are currently list-only in the CLI |
| `update accounts -b <id> [--fields …]` | Reads CSV from stdin (or `--in`), fetches each current account by `id`, and emits PATCH requests for changed fields only | CSV **must** include `id`; rows are processed in CSV order and may repeat an `id` |
| `update contacts -b <id> [--fields …]` | Reads CSV from stdin (or `--in`), fetches each current contact by `id`, and emits PATCH requests for changed fields only | CSV **must** include `id`; rows are processed in CSV order and may repeat an `id` |
| `delete accounts -b <id>` | Reads a CSV containing `id` values and issues DELETE calls sequentially | Extra columns are ignored |
| `delete contacts -b <id>` | Reads a CSV containing `id` values and issues DELETE calls sequentially | Extra columns are ignored |
| `delete documents -b <id>` | Reads a CSV containing `id` values and issues DELETE calls sequentially | Extra columns are ignored |
| `map accounts -b <id>` | Resolves source+target business contexts and emits `source_id,target_id,number` matches by account `number` | Prints missing-target warnings to stderr; exit code is `EX_DATAERR` when warnings exist |
| `create documents -b <id> [--account-id-map <path>] [--strict] [--fields …]` | Reads minimal document-create CSV and POSTs documents sequentially | Optional blueprint account-id remap via mapping CSV |

Unimplemented (exit code `1` with a TODO):

- `update businesses`
- `update documents`
- `create accounts` / `create businesses` (alignment currently assumes “desired state” rather than inserts)

## CSV expectations

- `--fields` accepts top-level DTO property names as comma-separated and/or space-separated input (for example `--fields "id,name"` or `--fields id name`). The same selection applies to both output and input.
- `id` is always required when reading updates or deletes; if `--fields` is present, the CSV header still has to include it.
- Update rows are handled one CSV row at a time: the CLI fetches the current server-side entity by `id`, normalizes the requested patch against that fresh value, and only then issues a PATCH when something changed.
- Repeated `id` values in update CSV input are allowed. They are processed sequentially, so a later row sees the result of earlier successful PATCHes for the same `id`.
- Collections of strings are stored as `;`-separated lists. `option<_>` values use empty cells for `None`.
- Extra columns in the input are ignored when `--fields` is present; otherwise we validate that every header maps to a property.

Use `--out`/`--in` if you prefer explicit file paths over shell redirection.

## Configuration and runtime

`Nocfo.Tools.Runtime.ToolConfig` reads the environment and builds a `ToolContext`:

- Target/default context:
  - `NOCFO_TARGET_TOKEN` (fallback: `NOCFO_TOKEN`)
  - `NOCFO_TARGET_BASE_URL` (fallback: `NOCFO_BASE_URL`, default `https://api-tst.nocfo.io`)
- Source context (used by dual-environment commands):
  - `NOCFO_SOURCE_TOKEN`
  - `NOCFO_SOURCE_BASE_URL` (default `https://api-prd.nocfo.io`)

The context wraps the shared `Http.createHttpContext` and `Accounting.ofHttp` from
`hawaii-client`, plus the active stdin/stdout handles.

## Internals

- **Arguments** (`Arguments.fs`): Argu discriminated unions define `list`, `update`, `delete`, and nested subcommands (`businesses`, `accounts`, `contacts`, `documents`). `--fields` and `--format` live at the entity level.
- **Runtime + Streams** (`Tools.fs`): resolves env vars, builds `AccountingContext`, and routes CSV readers/writers.
- **Program flow** (`Program.fs`):
  - `list` commands: stream via `Streams.streamBusinesses`, `Streams.streamAccounts`, `Streams.streamContacts`, or `Streams.streamDocuments`, hydrate rows (`Streams.hydrateAndUnwrap`), write CSV lazily.
  - `update` accounts/contacts: read CSV into repo-owned delta records (`AccountDelta` / `ContactDelta`), fetch the current entity for each CSV `id`, normalize against that fresh API state, and PATCH immediately when something changed.
  - `delete` accounts: map CSV rows to `AccountCommand.DeleteAccount` and reuse the same execution + folding machinery.
  - `map accounts`: align source/target account streams by `number` and output `source_id,target_id,number`.
  - `create documents`: read minimal create payload rows, optionally rewrite blueprint account IDs, then POST documents sequentially.

Everything runs on `AsyncSeq`, so listing scales to large datasets without holding them all in memory.

## Limitations / future work

- No retries or backoff; transient HTTP failures halt the stream.
- No dry-run mode—`update` and `delete` execute immediately once the CSV is read.
- Business updates and account creation are placeholders.
- `update` trades extra GET requests for streaming-friendly semantics; very large CSV updates will be network-bound.
- `--format` is hard-wired to CSV; JSON or Parquet would require additional mapping.
- Packaging as a standalone `nocfo` binary is planned but not implemented.

See `../hawaii-client/README.md` for deeper implementation notes and ideas for extending the domain model.
